Therefore the core library has many functions that return a map. In this article, we'll explore some of these functions and  applications for them.</description><author>cassidy</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojurearcana.com/threading-macros/</guid><link>https://clojurearcana.com/threading-macros/</link><title>Threading macros</title><description>Threading macros are one of the most useful features of the Clojure core library. Similar to a fluent API in object-oriented programming languages, these macros are both more powerful and more flexible.</description><author>cassidy</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://clojurearcana.com/fun-with-strings/</guid><link>https://clojurearcana.com/fun-with-strings/</link><title>Fun with strings</title><description>Clojure provides excellent utilities for dealing with strings. Strings are also sequences and can be treated and processed as such. In this article we'll explore a fun way to solve a common problem using sequence functions on strings.</description><author>cassidy</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
